# Pokedex

I will recreate one of the most Iconic tools from the Pokemon anime. A pokedex is a tool that contains all the information about any pokemon found by the pokemon trainers. It will The users will have the option to search for a certain pokemon that they like , find information about the area where the pokemon will spawn, atack moves and  strenghts and weaknesses. If and in case this will turn out to be a good project I will like to implement a tournament choise faze where the user will choose three pokemons and enter the tournament.
